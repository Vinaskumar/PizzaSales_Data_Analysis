# PizzaSales_Data_Analysis

I dove into pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI to understand how our pizza business is doing. With SQL, I sorted through a bunch of data to find out things like which pizzas sell the most.

Then, I used Power BI to make a dashboardâ€”a kind of interactive webpage. It lets people click around and see different things about our pizza sales, like which months we sell the most, what sizes people like.

Join me on this journey through pizza data, and let's find the tasty insights together!
